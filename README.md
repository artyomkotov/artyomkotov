# Hey, I'm Artyom

Welcome to my profile. I'm a 16-year-old IT student at Elvebakken VGS in Oslo, heavily interested in tech and optimization of workflow and improvement of lifestyle. Currently diving deep into system automation, self-hosted services, and clean UI setups—with a soft spot for Xiaomi gear and efficient workflows.

---

### What I do
- Building and maintaining **Dockerized self-hosted servers** (WordPress, Plex, Radarr/Sonarr, Nginx Proxy Manager and more)
- Experimenting with **Linux systems** (daily driving Fedora KDE)
- Automating media libraries and remote access tools (Moonlight, Overseerr, CasaOS)
- Breaking, fixing, and optimizing tech—from mobile phones to multi-monitor setups
- Using AI tools like **ChatGPT** and others to bridge the gap between idea and execution

---

### My Setup
- **Main PC:** Ryzen 7 5700X3D / RX 7800XT / Fedora KDE / 3-monitor setup  
- **Server PC:** Ryzen 9 5900X / RTX 3060 / Ubuntu / 12TB Storage  
- **On the go:** Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro + Stylus, fully synced with my ecosystem  
- **Phone:** (currently bricked) Xiaomi 14, temporarily on Xiaomi 12

### I speak  
`English` | `Russian` | `Ukrainian` | `Norwegian`

---

### What I’m Learning
- Better Docker practices (volumes, proxies, permissions)
- Advanced system diagnostics and repair
- Smarter automation across my homelab and personal workflows
