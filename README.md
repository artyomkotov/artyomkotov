# Hey, I'm Artyom

Welcome to my profile. I'm a 16-year-old IT student at Elvebakken VGS in Oslo, heavily interested in tech and optimization of workflow and improvement of lifestyle. Currently diving deep into system automation, self-hosted services, and clean UI setups—with a soft spot for Xiaomi gear and efficient workflows.

- Experimenting with **Linux systems** (daily driving Fedora KDE)
- Automating media libraries and remote access tools (Moonlight, Overseerr, CasaOS)
- Breaking, fixing, and optimizing tech—from mobile phones to multi-monitor setups
- Using AI tools like **ChatGPT** and others to bridge the gap between idea and execution
